# Webpack Launchpad

## Welcome!
Webpack Launchpad is a small, easy-to-use and well-documented Webpack boilerplate for Webpack beginners. Use it to create your next amazing project or learn how to use Webpack.

Almost every line in WPLP will be commented so that you can learn what each line is doing and what is affecting. You may play around with the code however you like, or use it to start your own project as it is.

## Status
This project is not "done" yet -- though it may never be done as I may update it from time to time as Webpack evolves! Currently, there are a few things missing, but checkout what Launchpad is showcasing below.

## Webpack Launchpad Includes:

* Code Splitting
* Hot Module Reloading
* Source Maps (JS and CSS)
* ES2015
* [Cache Busting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/caching/)
* Environment Variables
* External Dependencies
* [Asset Loading](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/) (Images, Fonts, JSON [JSON is supported by Default])
* Three Shaking
* Webpack Dev Server
* Plugins: HMR, Extract Text, HTML Webpack, [Clean Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/output-management/), [PurifyCSS](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/purifycss-webpack)
* Loaders: SCSS, PostCSS (with Autoprefixer), File, [URL](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/url-loader), CSS, HTML, Style, [SVG Sprite](https://github.com/kisenka/svg-sprite-loader), [Img](https://github.com/thetalecrafter/img-loader).

## Rules

If you want to do a PR or commit some stuff, here are a few helpful points:

* Please don't use ES6/ES2015 at this time unless necessary. There are a few bits on this project that uses ES6/ES2015 (since Webpack 2 now supports it), but for the most part, keep it newbie friendly.
* Use 4 space tab :P -- no, lets not add a file to handle that.
* Keep it as light as possible!
* Document your code! Get really hand-holdy with it.
* Make sure you are using the best and latest way to do whatever it is you are adding!
* Please test your code!
* Be nice! :)

## TO DO

### Repo

* Add all to-do items to Github.
* Start docs explaining code.
* Start docs explaining how to run code.
* Link our sources to where we got all our plugins, loaders and such from!
* Check for typos and stuff that happens :P
* Test this in an actual project once all the points are done!

### Add to Launchpad

* Make sure we are not shipping anything to customers that we do not want.
* Use PurifyCSS to include Bootstrap (make sure it is a external source call?).
* Try to put the SVGs (and other assets) into the HTML template dynamically.
* WebWorkers/Offline Plugin/Webpack.
