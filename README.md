# Webpack Launchpad

## Welcome!
Webpack Launchpad is a small, easy-to-use and well-documented Webpack boilerplate for Webpack beginners. Use it to create your next amazing project or learn how to use Webpack.

Almost every line in WPLP will be commented so that you can learn what each line is doing and what is affecting. You may play around with the code however you like, or use it to start your own project as it is.

## Status
This project is not "done" yet -- though maybe it will never be done as time goes on a we update it! Currently, there are a few things missing and we just have the very basic.

## Rules
If you intend to commit anything, here are a few helpful points:

* Please don't use ES6 at this time. There are a few bits on this project that uses ES6 (since Webpack 2 now supports it), but for the most part, keep it newbie friendly.
* Use 4 space tab :P -- no, lets not add a file to handle that.
* Keep it light as possible!
* Document your code! Get really hand-holdy with it.
* Make sure you are using the best and latest way to do anything!
* Be nice! :)

## TO DO

* [SourceMaps](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/source-map-loader)
* [Purify]()(Removes unused CSS -- maybe Webpack does this by itself?)
* [Babel]()
* [AutoPrefixer]()
